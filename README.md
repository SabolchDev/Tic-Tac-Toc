# Tic-Tac-Toc

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid with the goal of getting three in a row.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the index.html file.
2. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbol (X or O).
4. The game will automatically switch turns between Player X and Player O.
5. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
6. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Installation

No installation is required; you can run the game directly by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
open index.html
```
